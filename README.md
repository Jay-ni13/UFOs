## Summary
Though this site's design is flexible its variety of search criterea input and the ability to use more than one criterea at the same time, it is cumbersome to initiate multiple criterea without a search button to click after all the desired text has been entered. Another drawback is having to refresh the page everytime to reset the table.
The current site has a good foundation for adding many more datasets--so visiters can really have fun with their queries--and for sourcing additional niche articles that can inform budding enthusiasts on what established ufologists have to say.
