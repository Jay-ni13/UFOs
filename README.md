# UFOs
## Project Overview
Building a dynamic webpage to engage UFO enthusiasts through articles on current developments in the field with input from famous ufoligists and collected data on UFO sightings around the United States with customizable search criterea.

## Resources

 - Software: JavaScript vES6+, Bootstrap v5.2.3, CSS v3, VS Code v1.73.1

After reading the article on the validity of UFO sightings, a [UFO Finder](https://jay-ni13.github.io/UFOs/index.html) visiter can utilize the array of possible filters to search queries they are curious about.

A visiter can search for sightings on a specific date--such as 1/13/2010--by entering the date into the date text box.

Sadly, when searching for possible sightings in Roswell, New Mexico, no matching results are found in the current dataset--the irony will not be lost on visiters.

Given California's landmass, it's no surprise that the state has 30 unique reported sightings between 1/1/2010 and 1/12/2010--we accessed the particulars of this search query through Chrome DevTools and the JavaScript console.

There are even two reported sightings in Canada in the current dataset.

Through the UFO Finder website, inquiring minds can even search for sightings by their reported shape--such as a circle.

## Summary
Though this site's design is flexible its variety of search criterea input and the ability to use more than one criterea at the same time, it is cumbersome to initiate multiple criterea without a search button to click after all the desired text has been entered. Another drawback is having to refresh the page everytime to reset the table.
### Recommendations
The current site has a good foundation for adding many more datasets--so visiters can really have fun with their queries--and for sourcing additional niche articles that can inform budding enthusiasts on what established ufologists have to say.
